    <p>The secret to doing anything is <b>believing that you can do it</b>. Anything that you believe you can do <strong>strong</strong> enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. <em>I believe talent is just a pursued interest.</em> Anybody can do what I do.</p>
